      <p> <h2><b> "Case Studies" </b></h2></p>
      <p> India </p>
      <p> India's growing population is putting a strain on the country's water resources. The country is classified as "water stressed" and a water availability of 1,000-1,700 m3/person/year. According to UNICEF, in 2008 88% of the population had access and was using improved drinking water sources. "Improved drinking water source" is an ambiguous term, ranging in meaning from fully treated and 24-hour availability to merely being piped through a city and sporadically available. This is in part due to large inefficiencies in the water infrastructure in which up to 40% of water leaks out.
        In the same 2008 UNICEF report, only 31% of the population had access and used improved sanitation facilities. Open sewers are common place in urban areas. A little more than half of the 16 million residents of New Delhi, the capital city, have access to this service. Every day, 950 million gallons of sewage flows from New Delhi into the Yamuna River without any significant forms of treatment. This river bubbles with methane and was found to have a fecal coliform count 10,000 time the safe limit for bathing.
        Due to surface water contamination due to lack of sewage treatment and industrial discharge, groundwater is becoming increasingly dependent on and exploited in many regions of India. This process is being expedited by heavily subsidized energy costs for agriculture practices; which make up roughly 80% of India's water resource demand.

      <p> Kenya </p>
      <p> Kenya, a country of 36.6 million, struggles with a staggering population growth rate of 2.6% per year (by comparison, the US population growth rate is 0.9% and the population growth rate in India is 1.31%). This high population growth rate has pushed Kenya's natural resources to the brink of destruction. Much of the country suffers from a severe arid climate, with only scarce few areas enjoying rain and access to water resources. Deforestation and soil degradation have made the available surface water typically highly polluted and difficult to retain. The government has been unable to afford to develop water treatment or distribution systems, leaving the vast majority of the country without access to water. This has also exacerbated gender politics, as 74% of women must spend an average of 8 hours per day securing water for their families. The growing population and stagnant economy has exacerbated urban, suburban, and rural poverty—exacerbated by lack of access to clean drinking water which leaves much of the non-elite population suffering from disease and parasites. This has effectively crippled Kenya's human capital. Private water companies have taken up the slack from Kenya's government among the wealthy, but the Kenyan government prevents them from moving into the poverty-stricken areas of the country in order to stop profiteering off the poor. Unfortunately, since Kenya's government also refuses to provide services, this leaves the disenfranchised with no options at all for obtaining clean water—or any water.

      <p> Bangladesh </p>
      <p> Historically, water sources in Bangladesh came from surface water contaminated with bacteria. As a result of drinking infected water, infants and children suffered from acute gastrointestinal disease, causing significant burden of mortality. During the 1970s, UNICEF worked with the Department of Public Health Engineering to install tube-wells, which drew water from underground aquifers, to provide a presumably safe source of water for the nation. The wells consist of tubes 5 cm in diameter that were inserted less than 200 m into the ground, and capped with an iron or steel hand pump. At that time, standard water testing procedures did not include arsenic testing. This lack of precaution led to one of the largest mass poisoning of a population twenty years later because the ground water used for drinking is naturally contaminated with arsenic. Because arsenic has no taste, no smell, and no color, its long term health risks can be harder for the inhabitants to grasp compared to the immediate threats caused by diarrhoea. Nonetheless, intervention measures such as awareness programs and painting tube-wells red if the water is above the government limit of 50 ppb arsenic (green otherwise) have seen success. As of 2010, 80% of Bangladeshis recognize arsenic as a problem. Available options for providing safe drinking water include deep wells, traditional dug wells, treatment of surface water, and rainwater harvesting. Between 2000 and 2009, more than 160,000 safe water devices have been installed in arsenic-affected regions of Bangladesh.</p>
